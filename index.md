## Who are we?

We are a [working
group](https://pages.18f.gov/grouplet-playbook/working-groups/) dedicated to
creating an environment in which working groups and
[guilds](https://pages.18f.gov/grouplet-playbook/guilds/) (both collectively
referred to as "grouplets") can thrive and have a meaningful impact on 18F
deliverables and operations.

## What do we do/what have we done?

We maintain the [Grouplet Playbook](https://pages.18f.gov/grouplet-playbook/);
actively poll other grouplets to raise awareness of their activities and
products; advise other grouplets on developing [Objectives and Key
Results](https://pages.18f.gov/grouplet-playbook/processes-and-artifacts/#okrs)
and artifacts such as [18F Guides](https://pages.18f.gov/guides/); and
encourage standards across grouplets to make them more discoverable (e.g.
Slack, GitHub,
[`.about.yml`](https://github.com/18F/team-api/tree/18f-pages/.about.yml), and
home page conventions).

## Where are we/how can you reach us?

Our 18F Slack channel is #wg-working_groups. We hold regular meetings on
Thursdays at 4:00pm Eastern Time.
